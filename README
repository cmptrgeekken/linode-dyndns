Usage:
linode-dyndns -k [api_key] -d [domain_id] -r [resource_id]

You can get the domain and resource ids from Linode's edit page for
the DNS entry you want to modify. They're found in the URL for that
page.

You may use the domain zone and resource hostname instead of the
domain and resource ID's, to have the program resolve them. Useful
since it appears as though Linode no longer provides the domain ID
in the URL.

By default, this sets the resource's IP address to your public facing
address. You can override that behavior with the --address option.
